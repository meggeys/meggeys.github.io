								<h2>Just a normal programmer?</h2>
								<p>No, I'm really not. I barely know anything about programming, to be honest. My interests lie elsewhere. I'm kinda surprised I'm even able to change this template and that I could upload that little Flask-website-quiz I made. &#128513</p>
								<p>So instad of boring you with what I cannot do (and maybe never will? Who knows!), I rather tell you a bit more about my other interests at which I'm way better!</p>
								<h2>So... What do I do?</h2>
								<p>Professionally, I'm a student in Linguistics at the University of Zurich. So languages are kinda my thing. I can speak 2 languages fluently (German &#127465;&#127466; and English &#127468;&#127463; ), have... some knowledge in French &#127467;&#127479; and just started to learn Spanish. &#127466;&#127480; My next goal is to refresh my Japanese &#127471;&#127477; and FINALLY learn Polish. &#127477;&#127473; &#128525</p>
								<p>Other than that, I enjoy making music &#127926; and playing video games. &#127918; A few times a week you can even watch me do that on Twitch. Why? Because doing those things are even more enjoyable when you can talk to people! It might sound weird to some people, but it's not for me. And the millions of others who stream every day.</p>
								<p>But music is really my biggest passion. &#127932 I started playing instruments in early musical education when I was younger than I can remember. From there, I grew into the keyboard group, then started playing the piano at 7. &#127929 At some point, I started taking singing lessons even tho I've always sung. &#128105;&#127995;&#8205;&#127908; When I was 10 I started to learn the saxophone in school. &#127927 With 15 I picked up a guitar for the first time and it has become my main instrument now. &#127928 </p>
								<p>At some point, I decided to try to make people happy with my music, so I started to stream it in June 2018. In March 2019, I wrote my first song since I started taking my music more serious. In November 2019, I released my first song on Spotify! Exciting, isn't it?</p>
								<p>Sometimes, I also enjoy other creative things like drawing &#128397;&#65039; or baking. &#129473;</p>
